SWAML - Semantic Web Archive of Mailing Lists
*********************************************

SWAML, pronounced [swæml], is a research project around the 
semantic web technologies to publish the mailing lists´s archive 
into a RDF format, developed at University of Oviedo (Spain). 

SWAML reads a collection of email messages stored in a mailbox 
(from a mailing list compatible with RFC 4155) and generates a 
RDF description. It is written in Python using SIOC as the main 
ontology to represent in RDF a mailing list.

Our homepage is:

Development happens on BerliOS Forge:

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

    - python >= 2.4.0
    - python-rdflib >= 2.4.0
    - python-xml >= 0.8.4
    - python-sparqlwrapper >= 1.1.0


USAGE
-----

    1) Create a configuration file (directory "config" contains some examples)
    2) Run SWAML:
        a) if it is not installed:
            $ python run.py youconfig.ini
        b) if it is installe din your system:
            $ swaml yourconfig.ini

For the moment SWAML only supports mailbox format, so if you have a maildir 
you will need to transform it:

    $ find maildir/ -type f -print | while read f; do formail <$f; done > mbox


FEATURES:
---------
     
    * platform independent (written in python)
    * shell mode (to use manually or by cron script)
    * compatible with RFC 4155
    * serialize to disk in RDF/XML and XHTML+RDFa, using (optional) HTTP content negotiation
    * reusability of ontologies already extended, mainly SIOC
    * enrichment with FOAF using SWSE/Sindice as source of information
    * KML support
    * GTK browser (Buxon)
    * free software under GPLv2 or later)


PLANNED FEATURES:
-----------------

    * RSS exportation of last messages
    * serialize to any RDFdb (sesame for example)
    * incremental exportations
