\begin{abstract}
The Online Communities are a very rich font of collective 
knowledge that are untapped. In this paper we present 
several approaches to mining this kind of communities to 
allow a semantic use of all this information. We focused
in discussion communities, such as discussion forums, blogs
wikis, and mailing lists, but the approach could be also 
applied to other kind of online communities.

\section{Introduction}

FIXME


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Technologies}

We use an ontology and RDF (Resource Description
Framework~\cite{RDF}) to publish online communities into 
the (Semantic) Web, while retaining the meta-data that were present in 
the messages. Additionally, by doing so, the information can be
merged and linked to other vocabularies, such as FOAF.

DERI Galway leads the development of SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online
Communities\footnote{\url{http://sioc-project.org/}}), an ontology that 
provides a vocabulary to interconnect different discussion methods such 
as blogs, web-based forums and mailing lists~\cite{Breslin2006,Breslin2005}.
SIOC is now an official W3C member submission~\cite{Bojars2007}.
SIOC has been used as the core framework to represent information from
online communities in all the work described in this paper.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Classification of SIOC-producing techiques}

Since SIOC is a recent specification, its adoption is still low, and
only a few sites export SIOC data. There are a number of techniques
that can be used to bootstrap a network of semantic descriptions from
current social sites. We classify them in two categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Those which require direct access to the underlying database behind
the social web site are \emph{intrusive techniques}.
\item On the other hand, techniques which do not require direct access to
the database and can operate on resources already published on the web
are \emph{non-intrusive}.
\end{itemize}

We further describe each category in the following paragraphs.

\subsection{Intrusive techniques}

It is safe to say that every social web site is built on top of a
database that serves as the information model. The web application
acts as the controller and publishes different views of the model in
formats such as HTML and RSS. In terms of this pattern, publishing
SIOC data is as simple as adding a new view.
From a functional point of view, this is the most powerful scenario, because
it allows a loseless publication due to the direct access
to the backend database.

The SIOC community is contributing a number of plug-ins for some
popular web community applications, such as Drupal, WordPress and 
PhpBB\footnote{A more complete and up-to-date list is available
at \url{http://sioc-project.org/exporters}.}. Mailing lists are
also covered by SWAML, which will be discussed below.

There is, however, a major blocker for this approach. All these
software components need a deployment in the server side (where
the database is). This is a burden for system administrators, who
are often unwilling to make a move that would make it more difficult to
maintain, securize and upgrade their systems. This is particularly
true when there is no obvious inmmediate benefit of exporting
SIOC data (\emph{chicken-and-egg} problem).

\subsection{Unintrusive techniques}

In absence of direct access to the database, unintrusive
techniques exploit the information already available on the web:

\begin{itemize}

\item Cooked HTML views of the information, the same ones that
are rendered by web browsers for human consumption.
Even if this source is always available,
its exploitation poses a number of issues described in Section~FIXME.

\item RSS/Atom feeds, which have become very popular. They can be easily
translated into RDF data using XSLT stylesheets. Unfortunately,
these feeds often contain just partial descriptions.

\item Public APIs. The web~2.0 trend has pushed some social web
sites to export (a part of) their functionality through APIs
to enable their consumption by third-party mash-ups and applications.
Where available, these APIs offer an excellent opportunity to
create RDF views of the data.

\end{itemize}

A shared aspects of these sources is their ubiquous availability through
web protocols and languages, such as HTTP and XML. Therefore, they
can be consumed anywhere, thus freeing the system administrators of
taking care of any additional deployment. In contrast, they cannot compete
with the intrusive approaches in terms of information quality, as
any access to the data is not primary.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Case studies}

\subsection{From mboxes to RDF: SWAML}

The first approach uses SWAML~\cite{SWAML2007}. SWAML takes mailing 
list archives in raw format, typically stored in a ``mailbox'' 
(or ``mbox''), as defined in RFC~4155~\cite{RFC4155}. We have 
developed SWAML, a Python script that parses mailboxes and 
outputs RDF descriptions of the messages using the SIOC ontology.
SWAML is a highly configurable, non-interactive application designed 
to be invoked by the system task scheduler.

Some could think that this is a intrusive approarch, becuase it needs
to access on mailboxes to export RDF. But many mailing lists publish
their mailboxes (sometime splited by months or by days) directly by 
HTTP, so it is very easy to fetch (and merge) it. We have tested SWAML 
with the archives of the GNOME project, as we tell later in 
section~\ref{sec:gnome} of this paper. 

FIXMEEE	

\subsection{Scraping the HTML archives using XSLT}

Unfortunately, mailing list archives are often unavailable in raw
format. Sometimes we can only access to the ``cooked'' HTML
version of the archives. In such cases, we can use a different
approach: to scrap the data from the HTML file. As each web site
uses a different, customized template for these HTML files, it is
difficult to develop a generic scrapper. We implemented one
for the Debian mailing list archives. It first retrieves all
the relevant files by means of a web crawler. Then it tidies the
markup in order to obtain well-formed XML. During the last stage,
each file is transformed into RDF/XML using XSLT.

Using these approach we have collected \textbf{FIXME} RDF triples
from a selected subset of \textbf{FIXME: number of lists} lists for
the period 2005-2006.

\subsubsection{RDFa enrichement}

Another possible way is to take (X)HTML markup of communities and
enrich it with RDFa~\cite{Birbeck2006}, using XSLT or DOM. The process
generates an output in XHMTL+RDFa that could be easy extracted in RDF 
with one of the parsers available (such as RDFa Distiller\footnote{\url{http://www.w3.org/2007/08/pyRdfa}}).

This approach is quite similar than the aproach used in mle~\cite{Hausenblas2007}
project.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Common problems}

These approaches for mining online communities have some common problem:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Identities:} as it can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:foaf-sioc},
	a person (an instance of \texttt{foaf:Person}) can own many online 
	accounts (instances of \texttt{sioc:User}). So we must apply techniques
	(such as Smushing\footnote{\url{http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfSmushing}})
	in order to extract the real identy behind a online account.

	\begin{figure}[ht]
	 \centering
	 \includegraphics[width=7cm]{images/foaf-sioc.png}
	 \caption{\label{fig:foaf-sioc}Online identity, relationship between FOAF and SIOC}
	\end{figure}

  \item \textbf{Problems with sha1 algorithm:} related with previous problem,
	we detected a problem using sha1 algorithm~\cite{Eastlake2001}. FOAF 
	and SIOC use this algorithm (in properties \texttt{foaf:mbox\_sha1sum} 
	and \texttt{sioc:email\_sha1}, respectively) in order to protect email 
	addresses from SPAM attacks. And this algoritm is case sensitive. So,
	for example, if we take Diego's email address, we could write it as
	\texttt{diego.berrueta@fundacionctic.org} or as \texttt{Diego.Berrueta@fundacionctic.org}.
	Both are valid email addresses. But each one generates different sha1sum.
	This could  seem a detail without importance, but it really creates a 
	serious problem when try to identify persons/users using these
	inverse functional properties. Unfortunately in our experimientos we 
	have found many times this kind of problem.

\section{Experimentation with Free Sofware communities}

FIXME

\subsection{\label{sec:gnome}GNOME mailing lists}

GNOME project publishes archives of its mailing lists~\footnote{\url{http://mail.gnome.org/archives/}}.
It is an archive with around 200 mailing list with information of 
more than ten years of activity in the project. Fortunately these
archives are not only published in (X)HTML, but also there are 
available (gzipped) mailboxes for each month. So we wrotte a simple
crawler to fetch these raw data directly by HTTP, and merge archive
of each month in a single mailbox for each mailing list of the project.

Then we had all necessary information to start running SWAML on these 
more than 200 mailboxes. For a selected subset of the mailing lists, 
SWAML has produced plus 25 million triples.

\subsection{Debian mailing lists}

FIXME

\subsection{Ubuntu Forums}

Ubuntu Forums\footnote{\url{http://ubuntuforums.org/}} are a very popular 
discussion forusm among users of this GNU/Linux distribution. They have a 
frenetic activity, with plus than 4 million of posts in the moment we made
our experiments.

In these forums we used a quite similar appoach than with Debian mailing
lists. We analized the markup generated by vBulletin (CMS used in these forums)
and we developed some XSLT stylesheets to transform get instances of
\texttt{sioc:Forum}, \texttt{sioc:Thread} and \texttt{sioc:Post}. We 
selected only a subset of available forums to test our application, FIXME

\section{\label{sec:conclusions}Conclusions}

Semantic descriptions of online communities pushes them
into a new level of functionality. On the one hand, they can be
conveniently browsed and queried. Search engines can exploit the
metadata to improve their precission, and at the same time, to
avoid repeated results.

On the other hand, the semantic descriptions can be
analysed and mined. Futhermore, they can be linked to other resources,
thus reducing the risk of creating an ``information silo'' and
enabling the rise of a network of ``linked data''.

So far, no semantic annotation relative to the meaning of
the messages is considered. Obviously, it is very difficult
to extract such information from the message text.
However, it is conceivable that it can be added by other 
means, such as social tagging using folksonomies, or parsing the 
RDFa that may exist in the e-mail messages that are send in XHTML 
format.The inherent community-based nature of mailing lists can
be exploited to build recommendation systems~\cite{Celma2006}.
