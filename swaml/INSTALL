Dependencies:

  To use SWAML core functionalities:
	- python >= 2.4.0
	- rdflib = 2.3.1 	(official releases at <http://rdflib.net/releases/>, warning: rdflib != librdf)

  And to use Buxon:
        - gtk+ >= 2.6.0
        - pygtk >= 2.6.0
        - gazpacho >= 0.6.6
        
As root user you may run:

	make install
	
This command will install SWAML at common directories. Then it'll be available
two new commands: 'swaml' and 'buxon'.

To uninstall it's also easy:

	make uninstall
