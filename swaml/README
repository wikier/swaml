SWAML - Semantic Web Archive or Mailing Lists
*********************************************

SWAML, pronounced [swæml], is a research project around the 
semantic web technologies to publish the mailing lists´s archive 
into an RDF format, developed at University of Oviedo (Spain). 

SWAML reads a collection of email messages stored in a mailbox 
(from a mailing list compatible with RFC 4155) and generates an 
RDF description. It is written in Python using SIOC as the main 
ontology to represent in RDF a mailing list.
